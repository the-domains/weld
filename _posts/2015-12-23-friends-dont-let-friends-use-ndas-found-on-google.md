# Friends Don't Let Friends Use NDAs Found On Google

Start-ups are hard. And not without expense. It's tempting in the early stages to avoid certain costs and in particular expenses that don't immediately appear to give you a lot of value for your money. This is especially true of legal services. When you are at the early stages of your venture, you are more likely to forego legal formality. You may even find yourself Googling for a non-disclosure agreement, thinking it's probably good enough to protect your interests until you have more funding later.

Can you use an NDA found on Google to shop your start-up idea / prototype around? Sure. Absolutely. Do your thing. But should you use that NDA? Probably not. Why? Well, there's a lot of things to think about when entering into a non-disclosure agreement with someone, particularly if you're the disclosing party. And many of those "basic" NDAs offered for "free" on Google either don't address these things or do so in a deficient way.

Here's a quick list of bare minimum things your NDA should cover if you're planning on disclosing information to a recipient under the agreement:

* **The definition of confidential information:**is it limited to information that you own? Or information that you are in possession of? These are not the same thing.
* **The purpose of the NDA:**does your NDA have one? Is the use of the confidential information limited to that purpose, or can the recipient party use the information for whatever purpose it wants?
* **The scope of confidential information:**does the definition of confidential information include oral disclosures of confidential information? Do you have to reduce all confidential information to writing, or does the agreement allow you to argue and prove, based on verbal evidence, the confidential information that was conveyed to the recipient?
* **The use that can be made of the confidential information by employees of the recipient:**who gets to use the information, and on what basis?
* **Rights of audit and inspection:**does your agreement give you such rights? If not, what's your plan to enforce your NDA, assuming the recipient will never admit it used your confidential information to do something and you don't have access to their records?
* **Loss of confidentiality:**when does your confidential information lose its quality of confidentiality? When it becomes "generally available to the public" or merely "publicly disclosed"? These are not the same thing.
* **IP claims:**what does your NDA say about the recipient company patenting technology that contains your confidential information? What if they claim ownership over derivatives of your confidential information?
* **Jurisdiction and choice of law:**what laws will apply to the interpretation of your agreement and can you even enforce it in your start-ups jurisdiction?

A lot of NDAs offered for free on the web simply don't address these issues. So you can use them. But it's buyer beware. Paying nothing for your NDA may mean it's worth just that much, and that's not a particularly fun thing to find out once your information is in the market.
